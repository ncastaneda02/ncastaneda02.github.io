                Hi! My name is Nicolas Castaneda. I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science. As probably evident from this website, I am a bit of a foodie. Iâ€™m a firm believe in food as the true universal language, and some of my earliest memories are of making food with my spanish-speaking grandparents who, at the time, I could communicate with in no other way.
                <br> <br>
                While now my professional goals are more technical, my backup plan life goal was to open up a food truck serving Peruvian-Japanese fusion, which makes a lot more sense together than it sounds, and represents who I am.
